# Siyu Zou (邹思宇)

Hello, my name is Siyu Zou, in Chinese "邹思宇". I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Soochow University.

Address: College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China

## PERSONAL INFORMATION

I received my Ph.D. degree in **Chemical Engineering** from [Soochow University](https://chemistry.suda.edu.cn/) (Suzhou, China), under the guidance of Prof. [Xiao Dong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fg3sXKwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Jie Xiao](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jie.xiao/). During My doctoral research, I focused on modeling and simulation of reactors with porous structures.

My main research interests are in **mathematical modeling** and **numerical simulation** of transport phenomena (fluid dynamics, mass and heat transfer, and reaction kinetics) in nature and industry, including porous media reactors, bio-inspired systems, and enzymatic reaction systems. My research methodology typically involved modeling transport phenomena using computational fluid dynamics (**CFD**) and validating the models through well-defined experiments. With over 8 years of experience in CFD applied to both academia and industry, I am proficient in using **ANSYS Fluent**, **COMSOL Multiphysics**, and **MATLAB**.

I am also an enthusiastic self-learner with a strong interest in various fields of computer science. I taught myself some programming languages (e.g., **Python, Rust, C**) and have solved some basic **data structures and algorithms** challenges using them (see my [leetcode record](https://github.com/zousiyu1995/leetcode)). I have also mastered the **LaTeX** toolchain to write mathematics and programming notes (see my [Github](https://github.com/zousiyu1995)). I possess basic knowledge of the **Linux** operating system and **Shell** programming. During my time at Soochow University, I was responsible for the daily maintenance of a Linux cluster.

Also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w6AliuwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN),  [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Siyu-Zou-3),  [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-9152-9844), and [Github](https://github.com/zousiyu1995).

In my spare time, I pursue diverse interests for a healthy work-life balance. I enjoy various music genres like Jazz, Blues, and Chinese folk music. I'm also a fan of strategy board games, particularly the German-style classics like Agricola, Carcassonne, and Castles of Burgundy. My art appreciation aligns with the spirit of jazz improvisation – I value creativity and spontaneity.

## AWARDS

- **2022.07, Jiangsu Funding Program for Excellent Postdoctoral Talent**: This funding is provided by the Jiangsu provincial government.
- **2020.07, Best Student Presentation Award**: In the 2nd National Conference on Process Modeling and Simulation, My talk on eyelashes ("Inhibition of Ocular Water Evaporation by Eyelashes: Computer Simulation and Mechanism Analysis") was awarded the Best Student Presentation Award (1 of 12 awardees out of 62 student talks). This work has been published in [Journal of the Royal Society Interface](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0425). This conference was organized by the [Simulation & Virtual Process Engineering Committee](http://www.ciesc.cn/branch/226), one of the professional committees of the [Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC)](http://www.ciesc.cn/).

## WORK EXPERIENCES

- **2021.07 - now, Postdoctoral Research Fellow**, [College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science](https://chemistry.suda.edu.cn/), [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), China. My Postdoctoral research focuses on developing a mathematical model for a three-phase enzyme electrode. This project aims to unravel the relationship between electrode performance and the structure of the three-phase interface and reveal the underlying mechanisms.
