## Personal Information

I received my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from [Soochow University](https://chemistry.suda.edu.cn/) (Suzhou, China), under the guidance of Prof. [Xiao Dong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fg3sXKwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Jie Xiao](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jie.xiao/). During My doctoral research, I focused on modeling and simulation of reactors with porous structures.

My main research interests lie in mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of transport phenomena (fluid dynamics, mass and heat transfer, and reaction kinetics) in nature and industry. I leverage chemical engineering principles to develop multi-physics models to understand, design, and optimize these processes. Some examples of application,

- Modeling and design of biosensor, e.g, enzyme electrodes.
- Modeling and optimization of chemical reactors, e.g, fixed bed reactors, CVD reactors.
- Understanding biological systems from chemical engineering perspective, e.g, eyelashes, digestive system, cardiovascular system.

My research methodology typically involved modeling transport phenomena using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and validating the models through well-defined experiments.

I am also an enthusiastic self-learner with a strong interest in various fields of computer science.

In my spare time, I pursue diverse interests for a healthy work-life balance. I enjoy various music genres like Jazz, Blues, and Chinese folk music. I'm also a fan of strategy board games, particularly the German-style classics like Agricola, Carcassonne, and Castles of Burgundy.
